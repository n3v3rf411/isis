== JAXB view models

This version recognizes classes annotated with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-XmlRootElement[`@XmlRootElement`]
as view models.  These are serialized out into XML and converted into URL.

The xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-JaxbService[`JaxbService`] is responsible for performing the XML conversion.
The default implementation is located in the `org.apache.isis.core:isis-core-schema` module, specifically under the
`org.apache.isis.core.schema.services` package.

If your application is bootstrapped using an `AppManifest` (recommended; ee
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[here]) then the `JaxbService` will automatically be discovered and
 registered.  However, if you are still using the older `isis.properties` configuration file to explicitly register
 services then you will need to add in this service.
