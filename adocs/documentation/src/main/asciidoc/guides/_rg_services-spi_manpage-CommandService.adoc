The `CommandService` service supports the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service such that `Command` objects (that reify the invocation of an action on a domain object into an object) can be persisted.

Persistent `Command`s support several use cases:

* they enable profiling of the running application (which actions are invoked then most often, what is their response time)
* they act as a parent to any background commands that might be invoked through the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`]
* if xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-AuditingService[auditing] is configured, they provide better audit information, since the `Command` (the 'cause' of an action) can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of the action) by way of the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[`transactionId`]
* if xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-PublishingService[publishing] is configured, they provide better traceability as the `Command` is also correlated with any published events, again through the unique  xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[`transactionId`]
* the associated xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-Action_command[`@Action#command()`] annotation attribute also allows action invocations to be performed in the background. In this case the act of invoking the action on an object instead returns the `Command` to the user.



The screencast below provides a run-through of the command (profiling) service, auditing service, publishing service. It also shows how commands can be run in the background either explicitly by scheduling through the background service or implicitly by way of a framework annotation.

== SPI

The `CommandService` service defines the following very simple API:

[source,java]
----
public interface CommandService {
    @Programmatic
    Command create();
    @Programmatic
    void startTransaction(Command command, final UUID transactionId);
    @Programmatic
    void complete(Command command);
    @Programmatic
    boolean persistIfPossible(Command command);
}
----

where `Command` is defined as defined by the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service.


== Implementation

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module provides an implementation (`org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.CommandServiceJdo`) that persists ``Command``s using the JDO/DataNucleus object store.  It further provides a number of supporting services:

* `org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.CommandServiceJdoRepository` is a repository to search for persisted ``Command``s

* `org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.CommandServiceJdoContributions` contributes actions for searching for persisted child and sibling ``Command``s.



== Usage

The typical way to indicate that an action should be reified into a `Command` is by annotating the action using xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-Action_command[`@Action#command()`].




== Registering the Services

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module provides an implementation
of this service (`CommandService`), and also provides a number of related domain services
(`CommandJdoRepository` and `CommandServiceJdoContributions`).  This
module also provides service implementations of the
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-CommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`].

Assuming that an `AppManifest` is being used to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app])
then this can be activated by updating the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.

If contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a
xref:ug.adoc#_ug_more-advanced_decoupling_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].




== Related Services

As discussed above, this service supports the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-CommandContext[`CommandContext`], providing the ability for `Command` objects to be
persisted. This is closely related to the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]that allows the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] to schedule commands for background/asynchronous execution.

The implementations of `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` are intended to go together, so that persistent parent `Command`s can be associated with their child background `Command`s.

The services provided by this module combines very well with the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-AuditingService[`AuditingService`].  The `CommandService` captures the _cause_ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the `AuditingService3` captures the _effect_ of that interaction in terms of changed state.

You may also want to configure the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-PublishingService[`PublishingService`].

All three of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[`HasTransactionId`] interface.
