The `CommandContext` service is a xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-RequestScoped[request-scoped] service that reifies the invocation of an action on a domain object into an object itself. This reified information is encapsulated within the `Command` object.

By default, the `Command` is held in-memory only; once the action invocation has completed, the `Command` object is gone. The optional
 supporting xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-CommandService[`CommandService`] enables the implementation of `Command` to be pluggable. With an appropriate implementation (eg as provided by the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module's xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-CommandService[`CommandService`]) the `Command` may then be persisted.

Persistent ``Command``s support several use cases:

* they enable profiling of the running application (which actions are invoked then most often, what is their response time)
* they act as a parent to any background commands that might be invoked through the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`]
* if xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-AuditingService[`AuditingService`] is configured, they provide better audit information, since the `Command` (the 'cause' of an action) can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of the action) through the unique `transactionId` GUID
* if xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-PublishingService[`PublishingService`] is configured, they provide better traceability as the `Command` is also correlated with any published events, again through the unique `transactionId` GUID

Assuming that the `CommandService` supports persistent `Command`s, the associated xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-Action_command[`@Action#command()`] annotation also allows action invocations to be performed in the background. In this case the act of invoking the action on an object instead returns the `Command` to the user.

== Screencast


The screencast provides a run-through of the command (profiling) service, auditing service, publishing service. It also shows how commands can be run in the background either explicitly by scheduling through the background service or implicitly by way of a framework annotation.

== API & Implementation

The `CommandContext` request-scoped service defines the following very simple API:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
public class CommandContext {
    @Programmatic
    public Command getCommand() { ... }
}
----

This class (`o.a.i.applib.services.CommandContext`) is also the default implementation.  Under normal circumstances there shouldn't be any need to replace this implementation with another.

The `Command` type referenced above is in fact an interface, defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Command extends HasTransactionId {

    public abstract String getUser();               // <1>
    public abstract Timestamp getTimestamp();       // <2>

    public abstract Bookmark getTarget();           // <3>
    public abstract String getMemberIdentifier();   // <4>
    public abstract String getTargetClass();        // <5>
    public abstract String getTargetAction();       // <6>
    public String getArguments();                   // <7>
    public String getMemento();                     // <8>

    public ExecuteIn getExecuteIn();                // <9>
    public Executor getExecutor();                  // <10>
    public Persistence getPersistence();            // <11>
    public boolean isPersistHint();                 // <12>

    public abstract Timestamp getStartedAt();       // <13>
    public abstract Timestamp getCompletedAt();     // <14>
    public Command getParent();                     // <15>

    public Bookmark getResult();                    // <16>
    public String getException();                   // <17>
}
----
<1> `getUser()` - is the user that initiated the action.
<2> `getTimestamp()` - the date/time at which this action was created.
<3> `getTarget()` - bookmark of the target object (entity or service) on which this action was performed
<4> `getMemberIdentifier()` - holds a string representation of the invoked action
<5> `getTargetClass()` - a human-friendly description of the class of the target object
<6> `getTargetAction()` - a human-friendly name of the action invoked on the target object
<7> `getArguments()` - a human-friendly description of the arguments with which the action was invoked
<8> `getMemento()` - a formal (XML or similar) specification of the action to invoke/being invoked
<9> `getExecuteIn()` - whether this command is executed in the foreground or background
<10> `getExecutor()` - the (current) executor of this command, either user, or background service, or other (eg redirect after post).
<11> `getPersistence()`- the policy controlling whether this command should ultimately be persisted (either "persisted", "if hinted", or "not persisted")
<12> `isPersistHint()` - whether that the command should be persisted, if persistence policy is "if hinted".
<13> `getStartedAt()` - the date/time at which this action started (same as `timestamp` property for foreground commands)
<14> `getCompletedAt()` - the date/time at which this action completed.
<15> `getParent()` - for actions created through the `BackgroundService`, captures the parent action
<16> `getResult()` - bookmark to object returned by action, if any
<17> `getException()` - exception stack trace if action threw exception




== Usage

The typical way to indicate that an action should be treated as a command is to annotate it with the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-Action_command[`@Action#command()`] annotation.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(command=CommandReification.ENABLED)
    public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
}
----


[TIP]
====
As an alternative to annotating every action with `@Action#command()`, alternatively this can be configured as the default using `isis.services.command.actions` configuration property.

See xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-Action_command[`@Action#command()`] and xref:rg.adoc#_rg_runtime_configuring-core[runtime configuration] for further details.
====


The xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-Action_command[`@Action#command()`] annotation can also be used to specify whether the command should be performed in the background, for example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Command(executeIn=ExecuteIn.BACKGROUND)
    public ToDoItem scheduleImplicitly() {
        completeSlowly(3000);
        return this;
    }
}
----

When a background command is invoked, the user is returned the command object itself (to provide a handle to the command being invoked).

This requires that an implementation of xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-CommandService[`CommandService`] that persists the commands (such as the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module's `CommandService`) is configured. It also requires that a scheduler is configured to execute the background commands, see xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]).



== Interacting with the services

Typically the domain objects have little need to interact with the `CommandContext` and `Command` directly; what is more useful is that these are persisted in support of the various use cases identified above.

One case however where a domain object might want to obtain the `Command` is to determine whether it has been invoked in the foreground, or in the background. It can do this using the `getExecutedIn()` method:

Although not often needed, this then allows the domain object to access the `Command` object through the `CommandContext` service.  To expand th above example:


[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND
    )
    public ToDoItem completed() {
        ...
        Command currentCommand = commandContext.getCommand();
        ...
    }
    @Inject
    CommandContext commandContext;
}
----


If run in the background, it might then notify the user (eg by email) if all work is done.

This leads us onto a related point, distinguishing the current effective user vs the originating "real" user. When running in the foreground, the current user can be obtained from the `DomainObjectContainer`, using:

[source,java]
----
String user = container.getUser().getName();
----

If running in the background, however, then the current user will be the credentials of the background process, for example as run by a Quartz scheduler job.

The domain object can still obtain the original ("effective") user that caused the job to be created, using:

[source,java]
----
String user = commandContext.getCommand().getUser();
----





== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `CommandContext` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
further in this xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_replacing-default-service-implementations["how to"] tip).





== Related Services

As discussed above, the supporting xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-CommandService[`CommandService`] enables `Command` objects to be persisted. Other related services are the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] and xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]). For `BackgroundService` captures commands for execution in the background, while the [BackgroundCommandService] persists such commands for execution.

The implementations of `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` are intended to go together, so that persistent parent `Command`s can be associated with their child background `Command`s.
