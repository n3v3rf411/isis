The `AuditingService3` auditing service provides a simple mechanism to capture changes to data. It is called for each property that has changed on any domain object, as a set of pre- and post-values.

[NOTE]
====
In case you are wondering what happened to `AuditingService` and `AuditingService2`, these were earlier versions of the SPI that have since been deprecated and removed.
====


== SPI

The SPI for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface AuditingService3 {

    @Programmatic
    public void audit(
            final UUID transactionId, String targetClassName, final Bookmark target,
            String memberIdentifier, final String propertyName,
            final String preValue, final String postValue,
            final String user, final java.sql.Timestamp timestamp);
  }
----

The framework will call this for each and every domain object property that is modified within a transaction.



== Implementation

The most full-featured available implementation is the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[Isis addons' Audit module].  This creates an audit records for each changed property (ie every time that `AuditingService3#audit(...)` is called.  The implementation is `org.isisaddons.module.audit.dom.AuditingService`.

The module also provides:

* `AuditingServiceMenu` service which provides actions to search for ``AuditEntry``s, underneath an 'Activity' menu on the secondary menu bar.

* `AuditingServiceRepository` service to to search for persisted `AuditEntry``s.  None of its actions are visible in the user interface (they are all `@Programmatic`).

* `AuditingServiceContributions` which contrbutes collections to the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[ `HasTransactionId`] interface. This will therefore display all audit entries that occurred in a given transaction, in other words whenever a command, a published event or another audit entry is displayed.



If you just want to debug (writing to stderr), you can instead configure `o.a.i.applib.services.audit.AuditingService3$Stderr`



== Usage

The typical way to indicate that an object should be audited is to annotate it with the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainObject_auditing[`@DomainObject#auditing()`] annotation.




== Registering the Services

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[Isis addons' audit] module provides an implementation of
this service (`AuditingService`), and also provides a number of related domain services (`AuditingServiceMenu`,
`AuditingServiceRepository` and `AuditingServiceContributions`).

Assuming that an `AppManifest` is being used to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app])
then this can be activated by updating the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.

If menu items or contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by
implementing a xref:ug.adoc#_ug_more-advanced_decoupling_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].



== Related Services

The auditing service works very well with the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-CommandService[`CommandService`].  The `CommandService` captures the _cause_ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the `AuditingService3` captures the _effect_ of that interaction in terms of changed state.

You may also want to configure the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-PublishingService[`PublishingService`].

All three of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[`HasTransactionId`] interface.
