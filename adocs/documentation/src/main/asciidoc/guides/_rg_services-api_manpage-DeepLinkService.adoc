The `DeepLinkService` provides the ability to obtain a `java.net.URI` that links to a representation of any (persisted) domain entity or
view model.

A typical use case is to generate a clickable link for rendering in an email, PDF, tweet or other communication.



== API & Implementation

The API defined by `DeepLinkService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface DeepLinkService {
    URI deepLinkFor(Object domainObject); // <1>
}
----
<1> Creates a URI that can be used to obtain a representation of the provided domain object in one of the Apache Isis viewers.

The xref:ug.adoc#_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] this provides an implementation for accessing the representation through this viewer.  (For the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[RestfulObjects viewer], a URL can be constructed according to the link:http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] in conjunction with a `Bookmark` obtained via the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`]).



== Usage within the framework

The xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-EmailNotificationService[`EmailNotificationService`] uses this service in order to generate emails as part of xref:ug.adoc#_ug_wicket-viewer_features_user-registration[user registration].



== Implementations

The Wicket viewer core framework provides a default implementation of this API:

* `org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.DeepLinkServiceWicket`




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]), _and_ that the
xref:ug.adoc#_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] is being used, then an implementation of `DeepLinkService` is
automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
further in this xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_replacing-default-service-implementations["how to"] tip).
