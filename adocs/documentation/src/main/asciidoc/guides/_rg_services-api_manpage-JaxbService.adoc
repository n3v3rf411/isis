The `JaxbService` (`1.11.0-SNAPSHOT`) allows instances of JAXB-annotated classes to be marshalled to XML and
unmarshalled from XML back into domain objects.





[[_rg_services-api_manpage-JaxbService_api-and-implementation]]
== API & Implementation

The API defined by `JaxbService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface JaxbService {
    @Programmatic
    <T> T fromXml(Class<T> domainClass, String xml);                                            // <1>
    @Programmatic
    public String toXml(final Object domainObject);                                             // <2>
    public enum IsisSchemas {                                                                   // <3>
        INCLUDE, IGNORE
    }
    @Programmatic
    public Map<String, String> toXsd(final Object domainObject, final IsisSchemas isSchemas);} // <4>
----
<1> unmarshalls the XML into an instance of the class.
<2> marshalls the domain object into XML
<3> whether to include or exclude the Isis schemas in the generated map of XSDs.  Discussed further below.
<4> generates a map of each of the schemas referenced; the key is the schema namespace, the value is the XML of the schema itself.

With respect to the `IsisSchemas` enum: a JAXB-annotated domain object will live in its own XSD namespace and may
reference multiple other XSD schemas.  In particular, many JAXB domain objects will reference the
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_schema[common Isis schemas] (for example the `OidDto` class that represents a reference to
a persistent entity).  The enum indicates whether these schemas should be included or excluded from the map.

Isis provides a default implementation of the service, `o.a.i.schema.services.jaxb.JaxbServiceDefault`.



== Usage within the framework

This service is provided as a convenience for applications, but is also used internally by the framework to
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-XmlRootElement[`@XmlRootElement`]-annotated
xref:ug.adoc#_ug_more-advanced_view-models[view models].  The functionality to download XML and XSD schemas is also
exposed in the UI through mixins to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_roles_manpage-Dto[`Dto`] interface.



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `JaxbService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`)
so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
further in this xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_replacing-default-service-implementations["how to"] tip).
