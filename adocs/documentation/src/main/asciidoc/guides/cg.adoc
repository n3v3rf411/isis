== Contributors' Guide

This contributors' guide has three related audiences:

* programmers who want to just use Apache Isis to build applications, and want help setting up their development environment or to build their code from the command line (eg to execute within a continuous integration server such as Jenkins)

* programmers who want to contribute back patches (bug fixes, new features) either to the codebase or the framework's documentation

* committers of Apache Isis itself who want guidance on release process, publishing documents and other related procedures.

This contributors' guide is _not_ intended as a reference manual; for that see the *xref:rg.adoc#_rg[Reference Guide]*.  This guide also doesn't describe how to actually build an Apache Isis application; for that see the *xref:ug.adoc#_ug[Users' Guide]*.
