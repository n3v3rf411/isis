== Users' Guide

This users' guide introduces the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_core-concepts[core concepts] and ideas behind Apache Isis, tells you how to xref:ug.adoc#_ug_getting-started[get started] with a Maven archetype, and provides xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos[how-to]s and xref:ug.adoc#_ug_more-advanced[more advanced] guidance on writing maintainable larger applications.

It goes on to discuss the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer], both from an end-user perspective and also how as a programmer you can customize the UI.  There is a similar chapter discussing the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[Restful Objects viewer] which provides Apache Isis' REST API.  The guide also explains how to configure xref:ug.adoc#_ug_security[security], principally involving Apache Isis' integration with Apache Shiro.

Later chapters discuss essential topics such as xref:ug.adoc#_ug_testing[testing] and how to xref:ug.adoc#_ug_deployment[deploy] your app, and discuss other ways in which you can xref:ug.adoc#_ug_extending[extend] or adapt the framework itself to your particular needs.

This users' guide is _not_ intended as a reference manual; for that see the *xref:rg.adoc#_rg[Reference Guide]*.  This guide also doesn't explain how to setup your development environment; for that see the *xref:cg.adoc#_cg[Contributors' Guide]*.
