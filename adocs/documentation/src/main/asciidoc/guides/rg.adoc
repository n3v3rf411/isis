== Reference Guide

This reference guide describes in detail the various elements of the Apache Isis Programming Model.  Most notably these are the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations[annotations] (such as `@DomainObject`), and the reserved and prefix xref:rg.adoc#_rg_methods[methods] (such as `title()` and `validate...()`); it also includes various utility and supporting xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes[classes].

This guide also documents the domain services, both those that act as an xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api[API] (implemented by the framework for your domain objects to call), and those domain services that act as an xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi[SPI] (implemented by your domain application and which are called by the framework).

Also part of the reference manual are the details of how to influence the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_object-layout[UI layout] of your domain objects (this is ultimately just a type of metadata), and it catalogues all the various xref:rg.adoc#_rg_runtime[configuration properties] available that influence the behaviour of the framework and the API domain services.

This reference guide does _not_ describe how to actually build an Apache Isis application; for that see the *xref:ug.adoc#_ug[Users' Guide]*.  The reference guide also doesn't explain how to setup your development environment; for that see the *xref:cg.adoc#_cg[Contributors' Guide]*.
