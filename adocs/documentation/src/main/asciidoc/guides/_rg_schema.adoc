Most applications need to integrate with other apps in the enterprise.  To facilitate such integration scenarios,
Apache Isis defines two standard XSD schemas:

* the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_schema-common[common schema], which defines the `oidDto` complex type: the object's type and its identifier. +
+
It also defines some two further XSD types, which are building blocks used in...

* the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_schema-aim[action memento invocation] schema, which allows action invocations to be captured
and reified. +
+
The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] module uses this XML format
to publish messages onto an link:http://activemq.apache.org[Apache ActiveMQ] message queue.

The sections below discuss these schemas in more detail.
