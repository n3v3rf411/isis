We provide IDE templates (for IntelliJ and Eclipse) for writing Apache Isis domain objects, and also for unit tests (JUnit and JMock).  We also provide them for IntelliJ for writing Asciidoc documentation (see also the xref:cg.adoc#_cg_asciidoc-templates[appendix]).

The most commonly used Apache Isis domain objects templates are also listed on the link:../cheat-sheet.html[Apache Isis cheat sheet].



== Installation

=== IntelliJ

To install in IntelliJ (Community edition 15), copy to the relevant `config/templates` directory, eg:

* Windows `<User home>\.IdeaIC14\config\templates`
* Linux `~/.IdeaIC14/config/templates`
* Mac OS `~/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC14/templates`

If using the Ultimate edition, the directory is `.IntelliJIdea15` rather than `IdeaIC15`.


=== Eclipse

To install in Eclipse, go to `Windows > Preferences > Java > Editor > Templates` and choose `Import`.



== Usage

Enter the prefix (`is`, `ju`, `jm`) and the IDE will list all available templates in that category.
