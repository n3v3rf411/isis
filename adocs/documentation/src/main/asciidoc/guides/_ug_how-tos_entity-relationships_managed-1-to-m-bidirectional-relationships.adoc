When an object is added to a 1:m bidirectional relationship, the child object must refer to the parent and the child must be added to the parent's children collection.

If there were no database involved then we would have recommended that you use the link:http://www.two-sdg.demon.co.uk/curbralan/papers/MutualRegistration.pdf[mutual registration] pattern to ensure that both the parent and child are updated correctly.  (The  xref:rg.adoc#_rg_methods_prefixes_manpage-modify[`modify...()`] and xref:rg.adoc#_rg_methods_prefixes_manpage-clear[`clear...()`] supporting methods were introduced in the framework primarily to help support implement the mutual registration pattern.

However, in a relational database, these two operations in the domain object model correspond simply to updating the foreign key of the child table to reference the parent's primary key.

So long as the parent's children collection is a `java.util.Set` (rather than a `Collection` or a `List`), the JDO Objectstore will automatically maintain both sides of the relationship. All that is necessary is to set the child to refer to the parent.

For example, all you need write is:

[source,java]
----
public class Department {
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(mappedBy="department") // <1>
    private SortedSet<Employee> employees = new TreeSet<Employee>();

    public SortedSet<Employee> getEmployees() { ... }
    public void setEmployees(SortedSet<Employee> employees) { ... }
    ...
}
public class Employee {
    private Department department;
    public Department getDepartment() { ... }
    public void setDepartment(Department department) { ... }
    ...
}
----
<1> it's the `mappedBy` attribute that tells DataNucleus this is a bidirectional relationship.  The value "department" refers to the Employee#department property.

Moreover, when maintaining a bidirectional 1-n relationship that is automatically managed by DataNucleus, it's preferred to "add" to the parent's child collection, don't set the parent on the child.

If you don't do this then you may hit a `NullPointerException`. The above idiom fixes the issue.

For more information, see http://isis.markmail.org/thread/ipu2lzqqikqdglox[this thread] on the Apache Isis users
mailing list, including this http://markmail.org/message/hblptpw675mlw723[message] with the above recommendation.

[WARNING]
====
In fact, not only do you not need to manually maintain the relationship, we have noted on at least http://markmail.org/message/agnwmzocvdfht32f[one occasion] a subtle error if the code is programmatically added.

The error in that case was that the same object was contained in the parents collection. This of course should not happen for a `TreeSet`. However, JDO/DataNucleus replaces the `TreeSet` with its own implementation, and (either by design or otherwise) this does not enforce `Set` semantics.

The upshot is that you should NEVER programmatically add the child object to the parent's collection if using JDO Objectstore.
