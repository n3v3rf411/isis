The `MetaModelService` provides access (albeit currently extremely limited) to aspects of Apache Isis' internal metamodel.

Currently this is limited to looking up the object type (as specified in xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainObject_objectType[`@DomainObject#objectType()`] and equivalent mechanisms, and as used in  xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BookmarkService[`Bookmark`]s and elsewhere) from an object's class, and vice versa.  In the future we expect other aspects of the metamodel to also be formally surfaced through this API.


== API & Implementation

The API defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface MetaModelService {
    @Programmatic
    Class<?> fromObjectType(final String objectType);   // <1>
    @Programmatic
    String toObjectType(final Class<?> domainType);     // <2>
}
----
<1> reverse lookup of a domain class' object type
<2> lookup of a domain class' object type




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `MetamodelService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
further in this xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_replacing-default-service-implementations["how to"] tip).
