The `MementoService` was originally introduced to simplify the implementation of xref:ug.adoc#_ug_more-advanced_view-models[ViewModel]s which are required by the framework to return string representation of all of their backing state, moreover which is safe for use within a URL.

However, it can also be used to create a memento of arbitrary objects. Indeed, it is used internally by the core implementation of xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] to capture the state of action invocations so that they can be executed by a background process.




== API & Implementation

The API defined by `MementoService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface MementoService {
    public static interface Memento {
        @Programmatic
        public Memento set(String name, Object value);
        @Programmatic
        public <T> T get(String name, Class<T> cls);
        @Programmatic
        public String asString();
        public Set<String> keySet();
    }
    @Programmatic
    public Memento create();
    @Programmatic
    public Memento parse(final String str);
    @Programmatic
    public boolean canSet(Object input);
}
----

The core framework provides a default implementation of this API, namely `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.memento.MementoServiceDefault`.  The string returned (from `Memento#asString()`) is a base-64 URL encoded representation of the underlying format (an XML string).

[NOTE]
====
In fact, the `MementoServiceDefault` implementation does provide a mechanism to disable the URL encoding, but this is not part of the `MementoService` public API. Note also that the encoding method is not pluggable.

However, you are of course free to write some other implementation of `MementoService`, perhaps based on `MementoServiceDefault` code if you wish.
====

The types of objects that are supported by the `MementoService` are implementation-specific, but would typically include all the usual value types as well as Apache Isis' `Bookmark` class (to represent references to arbitrary entities). Nulls can also be set.

In the case of the default implementation provided by the core framework, the types supported are:

* `java.lang.String`
* `java.lang.Boolean`, `boolean`
* `java.lang.Byte`, `byte`
* `java.lang.Short`, `short`
* `java.lang.Integer`, `int`
* `java.lang.Long`, `long`
* `java.lang.Float`, `float`
* `java.lang.Double`, `double`
* `java.lang.Character`, `char`
* `java.math.BigDecimal`
* `java.math.BigInteger`
* `org.joda.time.LocalDate`
* `org.apache.isis.applib.services.bookmark.Bookmark`

If using another implementation, the `canSet(...)` method can be used to check if the candidate object's type is supported.



== Usage

As noted in the introduction, a common use case for this service is in the implementation of the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-AbstractViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface.

[TIP]
====
Rather than implementing `ViewModel`, it's usually easier to annotate your view models with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`] (or equivalently xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature=EXTERNAL_ENTITY`] or xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature=INMEMORY_ENTITY`].
====

For example, suppose you were implementing a view model that represents an external entity in a SOAP web service.  To access this service the view model needs to store (say) the hostname, port number and an id to the object.

Using an injected `MementoService` the view model can roundtrip to and from this string, thus implementing the `ViewModel` API:

[source,java]
----
public class ExternalEntity implements ViewModel {
    private String hostname;
    private int port;
    private String id;
    public String viewModelMemento() {              // <1>
        return mementoService.create()
                .set("hostname", hostname)
                .set("port", port)
                .set("id", id)
                .asString();
    }
    public void viewModelInit(String mementoStr) {  // <2>
        Memento memento = mementoService.parse(mementoStr);
        hostname = memento.get("hostname", String.class);
        port = memento.get("port", int.class);
        id = memento.get("id", String.class);
    ...
    @Inject
    MementoService mementoService;
}

== Related Services

The memento service is used by the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service and also xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi_manpage-BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]. These both use a memento to capture a representation of an action invocation.




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `MementoService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
further in this xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_replacing-default-service-implementations["how to"] tip).
